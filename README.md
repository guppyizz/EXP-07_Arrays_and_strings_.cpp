## 📚 Theory

### 📌 Arrays in C++
An array in C++ is a collection of elements of the **same data type**, stored in **contiguous memory locations**. Elements are accessed using indices starting from 0.

Arrays are useful for handling large amounts of data and implementing algorithms efficiently.

#### ✅ Types of Arrays:
- **One-Dimensional Array** – linear collection of elements.
- **Multi-Dimensional Array** – an array of arrays (e.g., 2D matrix).

#### 🧠 Common Algorithms with Arrays:
- **Linear Search** – Search for an element one by one.
- **Finding Min/Max** – Traverse the array to find smallest/largest element.
- **Array Reversal** – Reverse the elements using swapping logic.
- **Sorting** – (e.g., Bubble Sort or Selection Sort)

### 📌 Strings in C++
In C++, strings can be implemented using:
- **Character arrays** (`char str[]`)
- **`std::string` class** (preferred in modern C++)

The `string` class handles memory allocation, copying, and null termination automatically.

#### 🧰 Common String Functions:
- `strcpy()` – Copies one string into another.
- `strcat()` – Concatenates two strings.
- `strlen()` – Returns the length of a string.
- `strcmp()` – Compares two strings.

## 💻 Implementation

The following cases demonstrate the usage of arrays and strings in C++:

1. ✅ **Basic Array Declaration and Printing**
2. 🔍 **Searching for an Element (Linear Search)**
3. 📉 **Finding Minimum and Maximum Values**
4. 🔁 **Reversing an Array**
5. ✂️ **Using String Functions (`strcpy`, `strlen`, etc.)**
6. 🔤 **Concatenating and Comparing Strings**

> Each of these tasks will be implemented using standard C++ logic and simple algorithms like linear traversal and conditional checks.

## ✅ Conclusion

Through this experiment, we implemented **arrays and strings** using C++ syntax and explored multiple operations using basic **algorithms**. The hands-on practice enhanced understanding of:

- Array structure and traversal
- String manipulation usi
